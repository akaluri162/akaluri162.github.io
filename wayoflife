    <h2> Way of Life </h2>

    This page is primarily deals with my spiritual ideas pertaining to way of life. At some point I could get into more practical aspects
    that define my way of life (Eg: technologies that are needed, etc.). Before going into the ideas, following are some initial conditions I have:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>I believe in existance of some higher power (My reasoning: <a href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/Pascals-wager"> Pascals Wager</a></li>
      <li>My ideas are currently restricted by the fact that I preceive reality in terms of space and time.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
    The current religions have been muddled by numerous mediocre preacher or gurus. Also, in the last 2500 years, entitled rulers have 
    changed the core tenets of various religion to their liking. This could be the idolization of kings by sycophant ministers and subjects.
    But in anyway there is a strong reason to take any ideas put forth by any religion with not just a pinch of salt, but with spoonful of salt.
    In this page, I will be exploring if I can put forth a group of rules that can be followed that will make more sense for a rational mind <sup>*</sup>
    i.e. if I can derive a religion based on the basic forces needed for my existance. Currently the ancient vedic religion (not exactly hinduism),
    is a strong contender.
