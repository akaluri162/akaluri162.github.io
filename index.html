    <h1>New Utopia</h1>
    <h2> Intro </h2>
    <p>Hi, I am Abi (Abhishek if you want to expend more energy). This is a minimalist/ brutalist website for my thoughts. 
      I will try to have only text and not any images on this site. Images will definitely help drive the point. But I assume a person who wants to explore this website will have the basic interpolation
      power to convert text to image in his mind. Also, my images may be limited by my creativity. So I don't want my limitations to govern
       the readers' thoughts. 
    </p>
    <p>
      As per the titel of the website, 'New Utopia', I didn't want to adapt the cliched version of the world 'Utopia' that was used by many
      tyrannical leaders across the history. So this is NEW utopia. It could include as ideas as banala as list of html tags or as abstract as 
      experimenting reality.
